HELLO REACT
---------------------------
- This is a demonstration of React JSX.
- We have a simple index.html file. 
- We are using <script> tags to bring in the React library from a CDN, however, later we will learn to bring in the React libraries/dependencies using Webpack. However, for now we need the React library to create our rendered component.
- We have a single <div> element with the id of app. We are also going to bring in our JavaScript code from our app.js file using the <scripts> tag.

- We have now have a scripts folder which holds our app.js file. In this file we have written our first JSX syntax:

   var template = <h1 id="someid">Hello React</h1>

- The JSX syntax is not recognised by the browser and the application will not work. All browsers support ES2015 code. The ES2015 syntax for the JSX code above is:

   var template = React.createElement(
      "h1",
      { id: "someid" },
      "Hello React"
   );

- We will use something called Babel to compile our JSX code into regular ES2015 code. 
- Babel allows us to use JSX, ES6 and ES7 coding features within our project files, and it will compile these codes into regular ES2015 (ES5) JavaScript which the browser understands.
- We would want to compile to ES2015 code because not all browser supports the newer ES6, ES7 syntax, this also allows your application to work on older browsers.
